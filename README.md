# Welcome to rfPresets for RotorFlight
**New flight controller base settings for our ELRS RotorFlight electric and nitro R/C Helicopters**


### About rfPresets
Goal is to get a new flight controller configured as quickly possible allowing the user to get to familiar FBL setup with all of the boilerplate stuff out of the way.
The idea is...
- flash the FC with RotorFlight 2.0 or later
- from the RotorFlight configurator CLI load the preset files that match your hardware, model (e.g. 400 or 700 size), base profiles and rates (optional)
- get straight to the familiar - name the FBL, verify gyro orientation, servo center/travels/direction, mixer settings, tweak PIDs and governor
- GO FLY

Even easier when used with transmitter models created with [etx-templates](https://github.com/bob01/etx-templates)


### Requirements / dependencies
- RotorFlight 2 or later


### Features
- some settings handled by presets
